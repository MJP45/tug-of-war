# tug-of-war
This game was designed to practise JS fundamentals and interacting with the DOM.
To do this I created a two player tug-of-war game with a scoring system and basic stylings.

## How to install
This project has no dependencies so a `git clone` will allow you to dive into the code. 

## Current state of affairs 
the game is functioning with the fundamental requirements listed above.

### Next Steps
The next steps in this project would be to randomise the distance the the 'boat' travels for each user key stroke.
